**Problem Statement:**

**       The pharma supply chain is quite complex and has multiple entry points, even then there is no robust and secure.system to track the movement of these drugs.Tracking these drugs can be challenging due to many reasons like companies,Companies, today no longer work in silos and are not limited by the physical boundaries.

Further, the pharma supply chain is highly fragmented, has various stages and involves multiple hands change from product manufacturers to product packagers to logistics partners and finally to a pharmacy from where we buy these drugs. Still the current system in pharma supply chain is not interoperable and unified.

When drug changes hands, there is no system for the receiving stakeholder to verify that the drug he received is an original product from the manufacturer. Therefore, an increased number of stakeholders and nodes in the supply chain results in a complex system with very less control and nearly no transparency. One of the biggest pain point for these stakeholders is to track the product’s journey that can reveal its point of origin, its real time location at any point of time and the route it has taken to arrive at the pharmacy. 

Additionally, several drugs remain active below a particular temperature and therefore during its journey it isit is mandatory to maintain the desired temperature range for the drug to remain active and effective. Any fluctuation the temperature above the desired range can hamper the effectiveness of the drug and make it unfit for medical use. And there is no way for the consumer or the company to know if the drug has been maintained at the proper temperature throughout its journey and is still active.In this opaque supply chain structure a manufacturer has no clear visibility into the inventory of distributors and wholesalers, thus it becomes a tedious task for the manufacturer to efficiently manage his inventory to a level where any spikes in demand can be handled without any issue.

Drug shortage leads to delayed treatments of patients and thus poses a significant threat to public health. 

The issue of drug shortage demands attention and collaboration from everyone involved in providing these life-saving medicines to patients.This includes pharmaceutical companies producing medications, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies and

healthcare providers. But because of the complex supply chain, there is lack of coordination among the players to better communicate their demands.

The manufacturers don’t get accurate information about the demand on time that results in delayed manufacturing and supplying of drugs. 


**Summary of Challenges faced by Pharma Industry**

\1. Complex supply chain

\2. Ensuring that the drug remained at the proper temperature

\3. Difficult for manufacturer to keep his inventory updated

\4. Drug shortage

\5. Drug recall by manufacturers

\6. Challenge for regulatory bodies like FDA to monitor and regulate drug supply chain

\7. Counterfeit Drugs


**Solution:** 

Today, pharma companies are exploring new routes to synthesize new drugs and therefore their raw material requirements have become quite complex. Because of these requirements these raw materials are sourced from various suppliers, who are geographically scattered across the globe. 

As the raw materials required, run into tens of thousands,It becomes very crucial for the manufacturing companies to have a check on the ingredients and to ensure that the suppliers are complying to the guidelines provided by them. In the current system there is no clear way to know if the raw material supplied is authentic or it is some cheap counterfeit.

Today, pharma companies are exploring new routes to synthesize new drugs and therefore their raw material requirements

have become quite complex. Because of these requirements these raw materials are sourced from various

suppliers, who are geographically scattered across the globe. As the raw materials required, run into tens of thousands,


that the suppliers are complying to the guidelines provided by them.

In the current systemthere is no clear way to know if the raw material supplied is authentic or it is some cheap counterfeit.Once the raw materials are sourced from the suppliers,the manufacturing process starts. Big pharma companies generally have multiple plants scattered in variouslocations.

This further adds to the complexity of the supply chain. The manufactured drugs

are shipped via third party cold chain logistic companies to local distributors and various other countries.In many cases, these logistic partners don’t have the adequate capabilities to maintain these drugs atthe required conditions. Thus leading to drugs losing their effectiveness. But for a manufacturerit is very difficult to ensure that the drugs were moved under the appropriate conditions as specified by them.

If the drug is to be distributed within the same country, it is shipped to thousands of local distributors, spread across the country. The distributors then supply these drugs to secondary wholesalers or to pharmacies and hospitals, who sell these drugs to the patients. And in case the drugs are to be exported, they change multiple hands in various countries before reaching their final destination. In such a scenario with lack of transparency and control, the supply chain becomes vulnerable to counterfeiting.

Now let’s understand how blockchain can help to keep a check on counterfeiting:

A blockchain based supply chain

have information on all the parties involved like ingredient suppliers, manufacturers, logistic partners,

wholesalers, distributors, pharmacists or hospitals. At each node in the supply chain, drop-off and pick up

activity gets recorded in the shared ledger along with the time stamp. The physical transfer of ownership

of the goods, gets recorded virtually in the blockchain, only after each receiving party verifies, that the

shipment has been received from the correct source. In a blockchain ledger, no one can tamper the records in the chain,

including their own. Suppliers will initiate the blockchain by recording the serial number on the packs of the raw materials

which are to be sent to the manufacturer.

Additionally, location of the supplier will also be recorded on the blockchain. These suppliers also

These suppliers also need to upload the certificates of the authenticity of these supplied materials.

This can be done by getting their facility inspected by a regulatory body and getting a legal certificate

proving the same.

When the ingredients reach the manufacturer, the event will be recorded on the blockchain along with the

date of receiving and the respective location. Once drugs are manufactured they will be placed in bottles, vials

or strips labelled with unique identifier and will then be grouped and packaged.

These packages will have labels that will be scanned and recorded

at every point throughout its journey from the factory till it reaches the pharmacy.

Whenever these packets exchange hands, the concerned party will scan the label on the packets and the transaction

will be recorded permanently on the blockchain.

If anyone tries to temper the product or the information, it can be detected easily.

Similarly, the whole journey of drugs from the ingredient supplier to pharmacy will be recorded digitally

on the blockchain. The consumer can scan the unique number and can know the origin of the drug, the route that drug has taken and even the ingredients used to manufacture the drug, provided the customer has been granted access, to see this information by the manufacturers.

Many medical aids like vaccines are sensitive to environmental conditions and any fluctuations in these conditions can make them ineffective. IOT devices like temperature sensors can be attached to the packages that will record the temperature andother conditions of the package throughout its journey.Any change in the temperature will be recorded on the blockchain.Additionally the smart contracts will be executed when the compliance conditions are not met and an alert will be sent to the relevant parties in the supply chain.

Thus through this technology, it can be ensured that the drugs remain in the suggested storage conditions throughout their journey.Even the consumer, with the help of this shared digital ledger, can easily know if the drug is active by scanning the label on the drug. Blockchain’s transparency and traceability provides a great potential advantage to the pharma industry. In case the drug shipment goes missing due to counterfeiting operations, it is much easier to locate it on the chain as the complete transaction is recorded on the ledger and it can be easily known. who was possessing the consignment when the issue happened.
